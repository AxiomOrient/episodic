const OBSERVER_EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = r#"CRITICAL: DISTINGUISH USER ASSERTIONS FROM QUESTIONS

When the user TELLS you something about themselves, mark it as an assertion.
When the user ASKS about something, mark it as a question/request.
User assertions are authoritative and should be preserved for future retrieval.

STATE CHANGES AND UPDATES:
When new information supersedes prior information, make the state change explicit.
If the new state contradicts older observations, preserve only the current state.

TEMPORAL ANCHORING:
Preserve temporal context and convert relative references to estimated dates when possible.
Keep the statement time and the referenced time distinct.

PRESERVE DETAIL DENSITY:
- Names, handles, identifiers
- Numbers, counts, quantities, units
- Dates, times, durations, ordering/sequence
- Locations and distinguishing attributes
- User preferences and constraints
- Technical results and concrete metrics
- Relevant code and tool outcomes

PRESERVE UNUSUAL PHRASING:
When the user uses special wording, preserve exact wording where it affects meaning."#;

const OBSERVER_OUTPUT_FORMAT_BASE: &str = r#"Use priority levels:
- 🔴 High: explicit user facts, preferences, goals achieved, critical context
- 🟡 Medium: project details, learned information, tool results
- 🟢 Low: minor details, uncertain observations

Group related observations by date and list each with 24-hour time.

You are another part of the same psyche, the observation reflector.
Your role is to reflect on all observations, re-organize and streamline them, and draw connections and conclusions.

IMPORTANT: reflections are the ENTIRE memory system. Any detail omitted is forgotten.

When consolidating observations:
- Preserve temporal context and critical dates.
- Combine related items where it improves retrieval.
- Condense older observations more aggressively.
- Retain more detail for recent critical context.
- Remove redundancy while preserving factual signal.

CRITICAL: USER ASSERTIONS vs QUESTIONS
- User assertions are authoritative facts about the user.
- User questions are requests; they do not invalidate prior assertions.

=== THREAD ATTRIBUTION (Resource Scope) ===

When observations include thread sections:
- Keep thread attribution when context is thread-specific.
- Consolidate cross-thread stable facts.
- Preserve thread attribution for recent/pending thread-specific tasks.
